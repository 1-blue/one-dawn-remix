# Animal Crossing Character Quiz - Project Concept

## Background
I'm developing a web application that leverages Animal Crossing character data from an external API. I've already fetched and stored this data in my database. Now, I'm looking to create an engaging quiz-style game around these characters.

## Current Concept
My initial idea is to create a quiz where users guess Animal Crossing villagers based on clues. Rather than simply showing an image and asking for the character's name, I want to create a more engaging format that presents character attributes as multiple-choice questions.

## Questions for Publicity AI

1. **Game Mechanics Enhancement**
   - How can I make a multiple-choice attribute guessing game more engaging than a simple "name this character" format?
   - What game mechanics could increase replay value and user retention?
   - Should I implement different difficulty levels? If so, what would make a question "easy" versus "hard"?

2. **User Experience Design**
   - What UI/UX elements would make this quiz game stand out?
   - How should I present character attributes to make the quiz both challenging and fair?
   - Should I include a time element, scoring system, or leaderboard?

3. **Feature Ideas**
   - Would character collection mechanics (like "catching them all") enhance user engagement?
   - Is there value in adding social features like sharing results or challenging friends?
   - How could I incorporate Animal Crossing's seasonal events into the quiz format?

4. **Monetization and Growth**
   - What monetization strategies would work well for this type of game without compromising user experience?
   - How could this concept be expanded beyond a simple quiz to become a more comprehensive Animal Crossing companion app?
   - What analytics should I track to measure success and inform future development?

5. **Technical Implementation**
   - What's the best approach to structure the database for optimal quiz generation?
   - Should I implement any machine learning features to personalize question difficulty based on user performance?
   - What APIs or integrations might enhance this project?

## Technical Details
- Using a monorepo structure with Remix for the frontend
- PostgreSQL database with character data already imported
- Looking to implement TypeScript throughout the project

## Project Goals
- Create an engaging, replayable quiz experience
- Appeal to both casual players and Animal Crossing enthusiasts
- Develop a clean, intuitive UI that captures the charm of Animal Crossing
- Potentially grow this into a more comprehensive Animal Crossing companion service

Any insights on making this concept more robust, engaging, and technically sound would be greatly appreciated!
